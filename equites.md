## Context
Ecosystems and biodiversity contribute to our society in numerous ways — from the production of food and timber to the regulation of air and water quality, as well as through outdoor recreation opportunities and the cultural value of species and landscapes. These benefits, also known as ecosystem services or nature’s contributions to people (NCP), are fundamental to human well-being.

However, access to these contributions and the ability to benefit from them vary among individuals depending on their geographic location, personal preferences, and mobility. As a result, significant disparities may arise between social groups, particularly in terms of age, gender, and income.

Climate change further compounds these challenges, threatening the management and conservation of ecosystems and altering their capacity to provide benefits to society. For instance, the increasing frequency of droughts and heatwaves may lead to reduced food and fodder production in many European regions. Yet, how these changes affect nature’s contributions to different people — and how they are distributed among social groups — remains largely uncertain.

The EquitES project aims to better understand how climate change impacts nature’s contributions across different social groups.

More specifically, our objectives are to:

* Identify the key socio-demographic factors driving disparities in access to, and benefits derived from, nature — and assess their impact on quality of life;

* Evaluate how different climate change scenarios may influence these disparities;

* Develop nature-based solutions that help mitigate these impacts while preserving biodiversity.

Our study area covers the broader Grenoble region in France.

### Distribution of urban NCP in the Grenoble Metropolis

The first study from this project focused on the main urban area of the study region, the Grenoble Metropolis. Urban green spaces provide many important benefits — from helping to reduce heat and flooding risks to offering places for recreation and relaxation. These  are essential for the well-being of city residents. However, these benefits are not shared equally across social groups. Environmental segregation, meaning the separation of population groups between areas with different environmental quality, is still common. Research in environmental justice has shown that low-income neighborhoods often have less and lower-quality green space. Yet, to support fairer urban planning, we need more detailed assessments that consider different types of ecosystem services and the diverse needs of communities.

In this study, we combined socio-demographic spatial data with NCP spatial modeling to examine inequalities in the distribution of three key services — heatwave mitigation, flood regulation, and urban recreation — in the Grenoble metropolitan area. For the urban recreation service, we created a novel recreation index that combines the quality and accessibility of urban green spaces.

*The newly developed urban recreation opportunity spectrum*

Our results show that low-income households generally benefit less from climate risk reduction but enjoy similar or slightly better access to recreation opportunities. We also find mismatches between where ecosystem services are available and where vulnerable groups most need them — especially in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

These findings underline the need to integrate social needs and vulnerabilities into urban greening strategies. Urban policies that go beyond simply increasing green space, and instead focus on delivering multiple, equitable NCP, can help ensure that all communities share in the benefits of a greener, more resilient city.

The study has been published online as a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.19.677080) and is currently under review.
