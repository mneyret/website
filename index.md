I am a plant community ecologist by training. I am  interested in the effects of global changes - either land use or climate change - on the structuration of plant communities, the ecosystem services they provide and more generally on the functioning of ecosystems.  
Besides my experience in plant ecology, I am also interested more generally in the interactions between societies and the environments, both in terms of providing guidance to environmental policies and from an anthropological point of view.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the[ Causes and Consequences of Biodiversity Change  group](http://www.bik-f.de/root/index.php?page_id=1227) of the Senckenberg  BiK-F in Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the [Biodiversity Exploratories](http://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/1/home/). My research encompasses two main axes. First, I am interested in how landscape management can provide higher levels of ecosystem services to a wide range of stakekolders. For this, I combine ecological data of ecosystem service supply in multiple land uses with social science data of ecosystem service demand from multiple stakeholder to identify "optimal" landscape compositions that optimise ecosystem service multifunctionality and equity. Second, I am using functional approaches to identify common "slow-fast" strategy responses of multiple trophic levels in response to land use intensity gradients.

I conducted my PhD at University Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development. I studied the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand. I investigated the relative effects of landscape, soil and land-use history on plant communities' structure and associated ecosystemic services. In particular, I showed that the expansion of rubber trees plantation into agricultural landscapes affects weed communities composition and  strongly increases soil erosion compared to annual crops.
