My research has focused on the effect of anthropogenic and environmental drivers on plant and multitrophic com- munities, as well as their repercussions on ecosystem functioning and Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP). I have investigated the mechanisms structuring plant and multi-taxa communities to environmental gradients, using both taxonomic and functional trait approaches, at different temporal and spatial scales. 



Over time, I have adopted increasingly interdisciplinary approaches to investigate the impact of land use on ecosystem functioning and the NCP it underpins. Combining ecological and social-ecological data in detailed landscape modelling approaches allowed me to assess the impact of landscape-level land use on the overall benefits derived by people from ecosystems. One originality of my research is thus to address the gap between the ecological (i.e. process-based relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning) and social (quality of life; social trade-offs between stakeholders) components of social-ecological systems.

I am currently a Marie Sklodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Alpine Ecology Laboratory (LECA) in Grenoble, France on the project EquitES: Towards high and Equitable Nature's Contributions to people in the face of global changes. I am also associated to the [RECONNECT](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2023/04/19/reconnect/) Bioriversa+ projet "Reconciling fragmented and contested landscapes". Through these projects, I focus on how restoration of landscape connectivity can promote both biodiversity and equitable Nature's contributions to different social groups.

My first postdoctoral stay was  in the [ Causes and Consequences of Biodiversity Change  group](http://www.bik-f.de/root/index.php?page_id=1227) of the Senckenberg  BiK-F in Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the [Biodiversity Exploratories](http://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/1/home/), where I focused on community-level functional responses to land use intensity and landscape multifunctionality. Before that, I worked as a PhD candidate in Sorbonne Universités (Paris, France) and Institute of Research for Development, where I studied the interactions between non-cultivated plant communities, farming practices and soil characteristics in Northern Thailand.
